# TCOAAL Saves

Collection of save files for "The Coffin of Andy and Leyley"

Save files are stored in:\
`%appdata%\CoffinAndyLeyley` on windows\
`<SteamLibrary-folder>/steamapps/compatdata/2378900/pfx/` on Linux through Steam Play


Open the game first and leave it open, move the save file to your saves folder and then restart the game. You can also rename the save file to change the slot it will occupy, highest accepted being `file50.rpgsave`.

## To do
- Add a few save files for certain stars in C1 and C2
- Finish playthough through C3 and add their respective save files
- Replace .txt files with .md files to make them look nicer
- (maybe (maybe)) make a simple webpage with some lists and screenshots to make finding whatever save file you need easier
