File 1:		Start of Chapter 3: Decay - Cliffhanger Route
File 2:		Andy is about to go after Leyley as she just ran out.
File 3:		At grandparents house, Andy needs to once again go after Leyley.
File 4:		End of flashback sequence, back to present.
File 5:		Interact with magazines to continue; you can run to the right as soon as dialogue ends to avoid the officers and get an achievement after leaving the store.
			Getting spotted leads to some interesting dialogue choices so I recommend loading back after the achievement.
File 6:		You can either go up or down, both will lead to the same place but going up allows you to pick the engagement ring.
			Picking the ring is only relevant in Shoots and Shots route (afaik). I picked it anyways because it was my first time going here and I wanted to read the dialogue.
File 7:		Start of Andrew's vision with the trinket.
File 8:		You can pick one of two options here: "Andy." or "Andrew."
			Picking Andy will lead you to an dead end, and you'll get an achievement for it.
			After you reach the dead end, you will immediatelly sent back to this moment, and will be forced to pick Andrew.
			Picking Andrew, before or after picking Andy, will lead you to the actual ending.
