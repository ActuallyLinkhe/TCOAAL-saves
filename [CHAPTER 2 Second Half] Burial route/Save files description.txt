File 1:		Chose "No. But trust the trinket.", Burial route starts. Ashley left to grab the rest of the money while Andrew finishes setting up the ritual.
File 2:		Andrew's parents are offering him a chance to give up on Ashley and side with them.
			Choosing "Reflect" will lead you back to Decay route, so just deny it to stay on Burial route.
File 3:		Clean the ritual remains.
File 4:		Start of the Burial dream sequence.
File 5:		You can finish this puzzle in two ways: 
			Heart, Sunshine, Broken Heart (left door) - This will lead you to the "true" ending where both Andrew and Ashley have that one dream of them making out.
			Sunshine, Broken Heart, Heart (right door) - This will lead you to an alternative ending without that dream, with a small puzzle to solve.
			Not sure if there are any other relevant changes in the game you pick the second one, so I went for the left door one in these save files.
File 6:		Hop on this one if you wanna go straght to the dream. Later after they wake up, Andrew asks to Ashley if she thinks they'll ever "come to that".
			You can choose between saying "Never." or "Never say never!". Again, not sure if this is relevant so I picked "Never say never!"
			(yeah i'm that kinda coffin fan how could you tell)
File 7:		Right after they get up, on their way to dump their parents' bones.
File 8:		Ending of Chapter 2.
