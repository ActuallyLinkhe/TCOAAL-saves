File 1:		Chose "No. But trust the trinket.", Burial route starts. Ashley left to grab the rest of the money while Andrew finishes setting up the ritual.
File 2:		Andrew's parents are offering him a chance to give up on Ashley and side with them. Not sure how relevant this decision is outside of some missed dialogue, so I declined their proposal in these save files. I'll come back to this later if this ever becomes relevant.
